With selection sort, it is possible to implement Linked List because the sorting algorithm mostly travels forwards with
one insertion at the end of each inner loop to get to the correct position.
But with insertion sort, it is a bad idea to use Linked List because the inner loop goes backwards with each iteration
to insert, so a Linked List would simply be too costly to use.
