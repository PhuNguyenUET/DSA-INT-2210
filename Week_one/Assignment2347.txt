2, Removing public, static or void results in unexecutable program due to the main method is required by JDK to be public static void main (String[] args)
    Removing args results in a parameter/array without a name, which will cause an error in compiling, making the program unexecutable
3, Writing the words public, static or void wrong will result in unexecutable program because those are keywords in Java, which is required to be written correctly
for JDK to be able to understand and compile.
    Writing the words args wrong will not have any consequences because args is simply a parameter name, which can be anything the programmer wants. In this case,
this particular parameter stands
4, 
a, It will result in an error because we did not pass in an arguments when calling the function, so index 0 will be out of bounds.
b, Depends on the terminal platform. I suppose that in some platforms, it can result in "Hi, @!&^%. How are you?", but I currently use zsh, which does not
accept & as a valid argument and result in "zsh: event not found"
c, Hi, 1234. How are you?
d, Error: Could not find or load main class Hi.java
e, Error: class found on application class path: HI
f, Hi, Alice. How are you?
7, It compiled fine, resulting in Hi.class but it cannot be run due to the main function's syntax, which
is required to be public static void main (String[] args). The syntax of the given main function does not
accept parameter typed from console, so it failed.
