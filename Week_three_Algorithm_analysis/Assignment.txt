Assignment1: The number of ways to select 3 numbers from N numbers is 6C3, which, if we calculate it out, is N(N -1)(N - 2)/6
Assignment5: a, N
	b, 1
	c, 1
	d, 2N^3
	e, 1
	f, 2
	g, 0
Assignment6:  
	a, NlgN
	b, N
	c, NlgN
Assignment7: We will analyze the count() function, by order of growth, it will be O(N^3)
Assignment13:
	a, 40
	b, 40
	c, 8N + 56
	d, 56
	e, 56
	f, 32
	g, 8
Assignment26: I will skip the theory proof and go straight to how I may implement it. So just take an array a[n]
 and plug each entry into the given algorithm in the form of (k, k ^3) and wait for the result
